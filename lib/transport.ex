  Creates transport specific connection and preserves it in state.

  Returns either `{:ok, state}` indicating valid transport state

  Synchronously sends given payload via previously created transport connection respecting given timeout.

  ## Arguments
  * `payload` - arbitrary map structure to be sent via transport
  * `timeout` - time after which `send/3` call should return immediately with an error
  * `state` - state structure containing valid transport data necessary to send payload

  ## Returns
  `{:ok, state}` on successful payload delivery
  `{:error, reason, state}` on delivery failure

  Handles messages received by connection process

  Main purpose is to parse messages sent to the process owner by the transport module.

  ## Arguments
  * `info` - arbitrary data to be handled by module
  * `state` - state structure containing transport data

  ## Returns
  on success:
  `{:ok, state}` or `{:ok, payload, state}` if message contained payload

  on error:
